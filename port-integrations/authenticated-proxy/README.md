# Authenticated Proxy

Opt-in support for HTTP proxies that require username/password authentication.
Chromium does not accept `user:password@` credentials inside the proxy list
passed through `--proxy-server`, so this integration keeps the proxy endpoint and
credentials separate.

Enable the integration by adding it to `port-integrations/integrations.json`:

```json
{
  "enabled": ["authenticated-proxy"]
}
```

Then rebuild the app/package.

## Environment

Preferred explicit configuration:

```bash
CHATGPT_LINUX_PROXY_SERVER='http://proxy.example:8080' \
CHATGPT_LINUX_PROXY_USERNAME='user' \
CHATGPT_LINUX_PROXY_PASSWORD='p@ss' \
./chatgpt/start.sh
```

`CHATGPT_LINUX_PROXY_USERNAME` and `CHATGPT_LINUX_PROXY_PASSWORD` are raw strings;
do not URL encode them. Optional bypass rules can be passed with
`CHATGPT_LINUX_PROXY_BYPASS_LIST`, which becomes Electron's
`--proxy-bypass-list` argument.

If `CHATGPT_LINUX_PROXY_SERVER` is unset, the integration falls back to common proxy
environment variables in this order: `https_proxy`, `HTTPS_PROXY`,
`http_proxy`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `all_proxy`, then `ALL_PROXY`. Credentials embedded
in those URLs are split into `CHATGPT_LINUX_PROXY_USERNAME` and
`CHATGPT_LINUX_PROXY_PASSWORD`; percent-encoded characters are decoded. If
`CHATGPT_LINUX_PROXY_BYPASS_LIST` is unset, `no_proxy` or `NO_PROXY` is converted
to Electron bypass-list syntax.

Common proxy environment variables are still URLs, so reserved characters in
embedded credentials should be percent-encoded. Use
`CHATGPT_LINUX_PROXY_USERNAME` and `CHATGPT_LINUX_PROXY_PASSWORD` when you want to
pass credentials as raw strings.

If a `--proxy-server` flag is already present in the merged Electron argument
list, this integration does not add another proxy server or authentication target.
There is no special parser for `electron-flags.conf`; persistent launch flags,
integration-provided Electron args, and command-line passthrough arguments are all
loaded into the same Electron argument list before this integration hook runs.
