# chatgpt-wrapper-updater

Default-enabled port integration that adds a **separate** in-app update path for the
ChatGPT wrapper: this repository's Linux patches, bundled integrations,
packaging glue, launcher, and `chatgpt-updater`.

This is intentionally distinct from `chatgpt-updater`'s official-app update
path, which tracks the official macOS DMG. This integration tracks newer commits
from the configured wrapper repository.

## Control Surfaces

- Settings -> Linux desktop shows **Check for ChatGPT updates**.
- Settings -> Linux desktop also shows **Ask which integrations to enable on update**.
- Both settings are off/on independently: wrapper update checks are off by
  default, and the integration picker prompt defaults on when this integration is built.
- When wrapper update checks are off, the in-app runtime does not spawn
  `chatgpt-updater check-wrapper`.
- When wrapper update checks are on, `chatgpt-updater` may check the
  wrapper repository for a newer Linux wrapper commit.
- If a newer wrapper build is available, a small top-right **Update** button is
  shown inside ChatGPT.
- The button stays hidden when no wrapper update candidate is recorded.
- The button tooltip includes the recorded wrapper changelog when available.
- Clicking the button may show the integration picker, then writes a pending marker
  and quits ChatGPT. The integration hook applies the wrapper update while the app
  is stopped.
- Packages built with `PACKAGE_WITH_UPDATER=0`, and AppImage builds, export
  `CHATGPT_PACKAGE_HAS_UPDATER=0`; the in-app wrapper updater stays hidden and
  stale pending markers are cleared because the artifact has no updater manager.

## Integration picker on update

Before writing the marker, the button can run:

```text
chatgpt-updater pick-integrations
```

This happens while the display session is still alive. The actual apply step
runs headless after the app exits.

The picker shows a `zenity` or `kdialog` checklist of optional port integrations,
pre-checked with the currently enabled set, so the user can choose which
integrations the rebuild stages.

- The updater derives the packaged persistent override from the resolved app
  settings path. A non-empty `CHATGPT_LINUX_SETTINGS_FILE` takes precedence and
  places `port-integrations.json` beside that explicit settings file. Otherwise,
  the default app id writes the chosen set to:

  ```text
  ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/chatgpt/port-integrations.json
  ```

  A custom app id replaces `chatgpt` with that id.

- The rebuild points `CHATGPT_PORT_INTEGRATIONS_CONFIG` at that file.
- The checklist is loaded from the recorded candidate wrapper source when one is
  available, so it matches the code that will be rebuilt.
- Integration ids that are currently enabled but absent from the candidate catalog
  are preserved.
- The special **(Don't ask again on future updates)** row, or turning off
  **Settings -> Linux desktop -> Ask which integrations to enable on update**, suppresses
  future prompts.
- Cancelling the dialog keeps the current integration set and still proceeds with
  the update.
- No display, no dialog tool, no recorded candidate catalog, or a dialog launch
  failure skips the prompt and leaves the current integration set unchanged.

## Update button states

- The action button is color-coded:
  - **green Update** means a genuinely newer wrapper-source build is available.
  - **amber dev mode** (non-clickable) means the installed build appears to be
    ahead of the tracked remote, so updating would be a downgrade; the update
    action is suppressed and the apply path refuses.
- The ahead-of-branch classification fetches the tracked wrapper branch and
  checks whether the candidate descends from the installed commit. Offline or
  non-git/frozen bundles clear stale candidates and show no update action.

## Why this is a port integration

The wrapper updater lives under `port-integrations/` because it is a packaged
runtime integration rather than a required core ASAR compatibility patch. Core only provides the
generic port integration loader and hook runner. This integration owns:

- the in-app wrapper update button;
- the Settings -> Linux desktop runtime opt-ins;
- the main-process bridge handler;
- the pending-update marker;
- the retry/apply hook;
- the updater command integration for wrapper checks, integration selection, and
  applies.

## Security Boundary

Generated UI state records user intent only. `chatgpt-updater` remains
authoritative for wrapper candidate identity, rebuild inputs, package
verification, and privileged install behavior. The bridge and runtime hook
require an available updater manager before showing or acting on wrapper-update
state.

## Build-time control

The integration is enabled by default in this fork. Disable it in the local
integration config when the build should omit the wrapper update UI and hooks:

```json
{
  "enabled": [],
  "disabled": ["chatgpt-wrapper-updater"]
}
```

For checkout builds, the file is `port-integrations/integrations.json`, and it
is intentionally gitignored. Packaged updater rebuilds instead use the
persistent override resolved above: normally
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/chatgpt/port-integrations.json`, or
`port-integrations.json` beside a non-empty `CHATGPT_LINUX_SETTINGS_FILE`.
After changing the applicable file, rebuild the app or package.

When enabled, the integration contributes three patch descriptors:

- `main-handler`: patches the Electron main bundle with the
  `chatgpt-linux-wrapper-updater` bridge handler.
- `webview-runtime`: injects the webview runtime that creates and refreshes the
  top-right **Update** button.
- `settings-toggle`: patches the current Linux desktop settings asset,
  `linux-desktop-settings-linux.js`.

The integration also stages the same runtime hook twice:

- `.chatgpt-linux/prelaunch.d/chatgpt-wrapper-updater-apply-pending.sh`
- `.chatgpt-linux/after-exit.d/chatgpt-wrapper-updater-apply-pending.sh`

Both staged hooks call `apply-pending.sh`.

## Runtime opt-in

The Settings toggles persist these keys:

```text
chatgpt-linux-wrapper-updates-enabled
chatgpt-linux-integration-picker-on-update
```

The settings are stored in the normal Linux app settings file:

```text
~/.config/<app-id>/settings.json
```

For the default app id, that is:

```text
~/.config/chatgpt/settings.json
```

The settings are persisted through the app's `get-global-state` /
`set-global-state` path, not through the official app bundle's typed settings
schema. This is important because these Linux-only keys do not exist in the
official schema.

`chatgpt-updater` reads the same settings and treats
`chatgpt-linux-wrapper-updates-enabled` as the runtime opt-in for wrapper update
tracking. The static updater config still defaults wrapper tracking to disabled,
so existing installs keep their current DMG-only behavior.

## Detection flow

When wrapper updates are enabled, the app starts a best-effort background check:

```text
chatgpt-updater check-wrapper
```

The command compares the installed wrapper metadata with the configured wrapper
remote/branch and records the result in:

```text
~/.local/state/chatgpt-updater/state.json
```

The webview button is shown only when this state contains a non-empty
`candidate_wrapper_commit`.

Relevant state fields:

- `installed_wrapper_commit`
- `installed_wrapper_version`
- `candidate_wrapper_commit`
- `candidate_wrapper_version`
- `wrapper_changelog`

`check-wrapper --json` is useful for local inspection.

## Install/apply flow

Clicking the in-app **Update** button calls the main-process bridge action
`install`. The bridge:

1. optionally runs `chatgpt-updater pick-integrations`;
2. resolves the current app state directory;
3. writes the pending marker;
4. exits Electron.

For the default app id, the marker path is:

```text
~/.local/state/chatgpt/chatgpt-wrapper-updater/pending
```

The integration hook then runs:

```text
chatgpt-updater apply-wrapper-update
```

Apply behavior depends on the install type:

- **User-local install**: prefers `~/.local/bin/chatgpt-update`, so it can
  update in place without privilege escalation.
- **Packaged install**: fetches the wrapper source, rebuilds a fresh native
  package from the cached/current DMG, and installs it with `pkexec`.

After a successful apply, the marker is removed, wrapper candidate fields are
cleared, and the app is relaunched by the after-exit hook.

## Failure and retry behavior

The hook is fail-closed:

- if `chatgpt-updater` is missing from an updater-capable install, the marker
  is kept;
- if the package was built without updater support, stale markers are cleared;
- if rebuild/install fails, the marker is kept;
- if required build tools are missing, the marker is kept;
- a lock directory prevents concurrent apply attempts;
- after a failed after-exit apply, relaunch uses
  `CHATGPT_WRAPPER_UPDATER_SKIP_PRELAUNCH_ONCE=1` so the next prelaunch hook does
  not immediately retry before the user sees the app again.

This means a failed update does not leave the app half-updated by the integration
hook. It leaves a retry marker for a later launch/exit.

## Local testing

Run the integration tests:

```bash
node --test port-integrations/chatgpt-wrapper-updater/test.js
```

Build and package with the integration enabled:

```bash
MAX_BUILD_THREADS=8 make build-app
MAX_BUILD_THREADS=8 make deb
```

Verify the installed build has the integration:

```bash
sed -n '1,160p' /opt/chatgpt/resources/chatgpt-linux-build-info.json
```

Verify the settings patch landed in the installed webview bundle:

```bash
rg "Check for ChatGPT updates|Ask which integrations to enable on update" \
  /opt/chatgpt/content/webview/assets/linux-desktop-settings-linux.js
```

Toggle the settings in Settings -> Linux desktop, then verify:

```bash
rg "chatgpt-linux-wrapper-updates-enabled|chatgpt-linux-integration-picker-on-update" \
  ~/.config/chatgpt/settings.json
```

Inspect wrapper detection state and the picker command:

```bash
chatgpt-updater check-wrapper --json
chatgpt-updater status --json
chatgpt-updater pick-integrations --json
```

## Troubleshooting

If either row appears but the toggle immediately reverts, confirm the installed
settings bundle uses `get-global-state` and `set-global-state`. If it uses the
official app's typed settings API, the app will reject the Linux-only keys.

If the **Update** button does not appear, check:

- the Settings -> Linux desktop wrapper update toggle is on;
- `check-wrapper --json` records `candidate_wrapper_commit`;
- `~/.local/state/chatgpt-updater/state.json` contains the candidate;
- the installed build includes `chatgpt-wrapper-updater` in
  `chatgpt-linux-build-info.json`.

If the integration picker does not appear before the update:

- the Settings -> Linux desktop integration picker toggle may be off;
- the app may not have a graphical display session;
- neither `zenity` nor `kdialog` may be installed;
- the recorded wrapper candidate may not include a readable integration catalog;
- the dialog may have been cancelled, in which case the update still proceeds
  with the existing integration selection.

If the app keeps retrying an update, inspect the pending marker and updater log:

```bash
ls -la ~/.local/state/chatgpt/chatgpt-wrapper-updater/
tail -n 200 ~/.local/state/chatgpt-updater/service.log
```

Removing the pending marker stops retries, but normally the marker should be
left in place until the underlying apply problem is fixed.

## Known costs and risks

- Packaged wrapper updates are heavier than DMG checks because they rebuild a
  native Linux package locally.
- Packaged applies require `pkexec` and a graphical polkit authentication agent.
- Detection needs network access to inspect the configured wrapper remote.
- Missing build tools are reported as an apply failure; the marker is preserved
  for retry after tools are installed.
