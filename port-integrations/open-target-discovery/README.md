# Open Target Discovery

Default port integration for ChatGPT open-target integration.

This integration augments the official OpenAI app bundle's Open menus with:

- a Terminal target discovered from `xdg-terminal-exec`, common terminal
  commands, or `.desktop` entries marked as terminal emulators
- Linux IDE/editor targets from known command-line launchers and dynamic
  `.desktop` discovery, including XDG, Flatpak, Snap, and JetBrains
  Toolbox-style entries
- a richer File Manager target that prefers installed file managers and can
  reveal files in Dolphin or Nautilus before falling back to Electron
  `shell.openPath`

The integration is enabled by default in this fork. It reads the current user's
desktop app entries and `PATH`, then launches the selected target as the same
user. It does not run commands through a shell, and it strips app-internal
Electron, Node, Codex, and wrapper environment variables before launching
desktop targets.

Target paths are validated before launch. This port integration rejects empty or
non-string targets, C0/DEL control characters, URL-like schemes such as
`https:` or `file:`, and raw values beginning with `-` before passing a target
to terminal, IDE, file-manager, `.desktop`, or Electron shell launch paths.
Normal local paths remain valid, including absolute paths with spaces or `:`
inside path components.

Disable it for checkout builds by copying
`port-integrations/integrations.example.json` to `port-integrations/integrations.json` and
listing:

```json
{
  "enabled": [],
  "disabled": [
    "open-target-discovery"
  ]
}
```

Then rerun `./install.sh` or rebuild the package so the generated app picks up
the changed integration list.

For packaged installs and updater rebuilds, put the same JSON shape at
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/chatgpt/port-integrations.json`. Checkout
builds ignore that persistent user file when the repo has a `.git` directory or
worktree pointer, so use `port-integrations/integrations.json` or
`CHATGPT_PORT_INTEGRATIONS_CONFIG` for development builds. For one-off builds, set
`CHATGPT_PORT_INTEGRATIONS_CONFIG=/path/to/file.json`.


Run the integration tests with:

```bash
node --test port-integrations/open-target-discovery/test.js
```
