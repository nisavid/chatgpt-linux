# Remote Control UI

Default-on port integration for the official OpenAI app bundle's
`remote_control` and Codex mobile surfaces.

This integration only opens the Linux UI gates. It does not fake backend state such
as connected clients, MFA completion, or remote control environments.

Disable it locally with:

```json
{
  "enabled": [],
  "disabled": [
    "remote-control-ui"
  ]
}
```

Run the integration tests with:

```bash
node --test port-integrations/remote-control-ui/test.js
```
