## Repository Role

This repository is a downstream maintenance fork of
`ilysenko/codex-desktop-linux`. The git remote named `upstream` is the
Linux-port upstream: it does the primary Linux conversion work from the
official OpenAI ChatGPT DMG and carries much of the Linux runtime enablement.
This fork is the finishing layer over that work: it preserves the local
`codex-app` identity, distro-shaped install layout, updater policy, hardening,
security review, and packaging/runtime polish.

Do not describe this repository as "the Linux fork" in durable docs or PR text.
Describe it as a local hardening and finishing fork layered over the Linux-port
upstream's work.

Use explicit upstream terminology where it prevents ambiguity. `Linux-port
upstream` means `ilysenko/codex-desktop-linux` or the git remote named
`upstream`. `Official OpenAI ChatGPT DMG`, `official OpenAI app bundle`, and
`OpenAI-hosted services` mean the OpenAI-distributed macOS app artifact,
generated bundle behavior, and service/account surfaces. Once a section,
document, or sentence clearly scopes the relevant surface, concise terms such
as `upstream`, `DMG`, or `app bundle` are fine. Do not use plain
`upstream` when both meanings are plausible.

Use `port integration` in durable docs for configurable build-time modules that
adapt official app behavior or local runtime helpers to this Linux port. The
implementation path and config APIs are `port-integrations/`,
`port-integrations.json`, and `CODEX_PORT_INTEGRATIONS_*`; use those exact names only
for source paths, file paths, and environment variables. Do not describe these
integrations as features of Linux.

Treat this file as always-loaded agent policy. Keep detailed package recipes, runtime notes, and validation matrices in maintainer docs when those docs exist.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Engineering skills publish issues and PRDs to GitHub Issues for `nisavid/codex-app-linux`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The triage vocabulary uses the five default engineering-skill labels. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Label governance

`.github/labels.json` is the source of truth for repository labels. Follow
`docs/label-governance.md` before proposing or applying classifications. Labels
are staff-managed, and `workflow: manual only` blocks item-specific mutation.

### Domain docs

This is a single-context repo. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Operating Policy

- This repository uses agentic engineering and operations. Agents should perform
  assigned tasks autonomously until they reach a boundary that requires
  stakeholder policy or an unavailable control surface.
- The user reserves authority over project initiatives and over initiation or
  continuation of work sessions. Within an active user-directed session, agents
  should drive execution, review loops, commits, publication steps, and cleanup
  unless escalation is required.
- Escalate when a decision or action impacts stakeholder concerns and the
  stakeholder's policy is unknown or uncertain.
- Escalate when an action must be taken but the agent lacks an autonomous
  control surface for it.
- When escalating a decision and a set of plausible, distinct choices is known,
  use a multiple-choice input tool if one is available in the interactive
  context. Include a way for the human operator to provide custom input.
- When escalating an action with a known prescribed path, present the steps
  clearly for the human operator to perform. Prefer fewer steps; present
  commands in easily copyable blocks, and prefer a single one-line command when
  practical.
- For every escalation, make the return contract clear: state exactly what
  result, confirmation, artifact, or output is needed to hand control back to
  the agent, and make it easy to validate.
- Prefer verified repository facts over guesses or aspirational guidance.
- When adding new agent-facing instructions, ask whether the information is
  durable, non-obvious, and useful before scouting a task.
- Remove guidance that becomes redundant with ordinary file discovery.

## Hard Rules

- `main` is protected. Before starting work, create and switch to a task branch.
- The first time a task branch is pushed, create a draft PR in the same workflow
  turn. Mark it ready only after local readiness gates pass and the PR body
  records verification evidence.
- Use `--repo nisavid/codex-app-linux` on every `gh pr` command in this
  checkout, including `create`, `view`, `ready`, `checks`, `merge`, and
  `status`. Do not rely on GitHub CLI's inferred repository; it can target the
  wrong repository in this fork checkout.
- Commit completed work before handoff. For long tasks, also commit at staged,
  functional cutoff points. Each commit must pass the normal checks for the
  changed surface before it is created.
- Before pushing changes that affect the generated app, installer, ASAR patcher,
  package builders, package payload, updater rebuild flow, or bundled runtime
  helpers, run a local app generation/build gate first. The minimum gate is a
  successful `./install.sh` or `make build-app` from the current sources plus the
  relevant local package builder when package contents are affected. Refresh
  `ChatGPT.dmg` first unless the cached DMG was refreshed within the last 24
  hours. Record the exact DMG refresh or age-check command and build command in
  the verification notes.
- Use Conventional Commits. Commit messages must accurately describe the
  committed change.
- Support the latest official `ChatGPT.dmg` and its current `ChatGPT.app`
  bundle shape. When official-app drift is repaired, remove obsolete fallback
  patch paths and version-specific compatibility branches in the same change.
- Treat updater, package-builder, launcher, and port-integration framework
  changes as cross-format unless the implementation explicitly scopes them.
- Keep app generation transactional: build and validate a sibling candidate,
  preserve the working app on rejected or inconclusive acceptance, and promote
  with atomic directory exchange plus the recovery journal.
- Do not hand-edit generated app output as the durable fix. Change `install.sh`, launcher templates, package templates, updater code, or shared helpers, then regenerate or inspect generated output as needed.
- Treat `codex-app/`, `codex-*-app/`, `dist/`, `ChatGPT.dmg`, and XDG updater config/state/cache paths as generated or runtime artifacts unless the task explicitly targets them.
- Do not assume `codex-app/` is pristine. If it disagrees with source scripts, source scripts win.
- Keep Linux package behavior in `packaging/linux/`, `scripts/build-deb.sh`, `scripts/build-rpm.sh`, `scripts/build-pacman.sh`, and `scripts/lib/package-common.sh`.
- Preserve this fork's intentional names when syncing from `upstream`:
  the app, install roots, launchers, package names, desktop files, and XDG app
  state use `codex-app`; the updater crate, binary, service, config, state,
  cache, and logs use `codex-app-updater`. Integrate incoming behavior under
  the local names instead of adopting upstream names.
- Preserve this fork's intentional layout when syncing from `upstream`.
  Path decisions follow these criteria in order: the XDG Base Directory
  Specification, the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, then common conventions
  used by mainstream Linux distros for modern Electron-style apps. Native
  packages keep the generated app bundle under `/opt/codex-app`, private
  package support under `/usr/lib/codex-app`, system launch and desktop
  integration under `/usr/bin` and `/usr/share`, and user runtime/config/cache
  and state under the appropriate XDG base directories. Do not adopt upstream
  `codex-app-linux` or `~/.local/opt` install roots as part of a sync.
- Preserve this fork's package version contract. Native package versions come
  from the official OpenAI app bundle's `CFBundleShortVersionString`, written
  to `codex-app/codex-app-version.env` during app generation. Do not replace
  that with timestamp-based package versions during upstream syncs.
- When syncing from `upstream`, use the user-global
  `syncing-forks-with-upstream` skill and the repo-local policy in
  `.agents/fork-sync-policy.toml`. Read
  `docs/maintainers/fork-divergences.md`,
  `.agents/fork-sync-policy.toml`, and
  `docs/maintainers/fork-sync-policy.md` before resolving conflicts. If the
  external skill is unavailable, follow the maintainer policy directly and
  record the missing-skill fallback in the sync ledger. Compare upstream
  user-facing docs against this fork's docs, adapting relevant facts under
  local names, paths, and policy. Escalate uncertain sync decisions to the
  operator when the session allows. If escalation is unavailable or the operator
  requested an uninterrupted run, record a durable, discoverable follow-up and
  link it from the sync ledger; do not rely on the PR body alone.
- During upstream syncs, reconcile renamed local files explicitly.
  Git's merge machinery may follow renames automatically when similarity is
  high enough, but agents must still check the rename map in
  `docs/maintainers/fork-divergences.md`. If upstream changes an old path that
  this fork renamed, port those hunks to the current local path and record the
  reconciliation in the sync ledger. Do not drop changes only because the
  original path is absent here.
- During upstream syncs, close reusable policy gaps before handoff.
  If the sync reveals a hazard that future agents could miss, update the
  narrowest durable policy surface and record the change in the sync ledger.
- Keep native-package-only launcher behavior in `packaging/linux/codex-packaged-runtime.sh`; `install.sh` should stay generic and load that helper only when packaging requires it.
- Keep package builders and `scripts/lib/package-common.sh` aligned when adding, removing, or moving packaged files.
- Preserve the unprivileged updater boundary. Escalation belongs only at install time through the updater's privileged install subcommands.
- If the updater crate version changes, update `updater/Cargo.toml`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and maintainer versioning docs in the same change.

## Patch And Integration Rules

- Treat `scripts/patch-linux-window-ui.js` as a build-facing CLI. Use the
  descriptor, runner, and helper APIs under `scripts/patches/` for patch work.
- Keep ASAR patches fail-soft and idempotent unless a descriptor is deliberately
  marked `required-official-dmg`.
- Do not recreate deleted compatibility barrels such as
  `scripts/patches/main-process.js`, `webview-assets.js`, or `shared.js`.
- Port integrations patch through `entrypoints.patchDescriptors`. Prefer
  declarative `resources`, `runtimeHooks`, and `packageHooks` to ad hoc
  staging, and keep resource targets inside the app directory.

## Triggered Guidance

- Changing launcher behavior: edit `launcher/start.sh.template`; if install-time launcher identity or orchestration is involved, edit `install.sh`; if package-only behavior is involved, edit `packaging/linux/codex-packaged-runtime.sh`; then regenerate or inspect `codex-app/start.sh`.
- Changing ASAR patches or Linux window behavior: edit the patching path from `install.sh` and `scripts/patch-linux-window-ui.js`; keep patches fail-soft when they target volatile official app bundles.
- Changing webview serving: read `docs/webview-server-evaluation.md` before changing the local server model or port behavior.
- Changing package contents: update the relevant file under `packaging/linux/`, the affected package builder, and `scripts/lib/package-common.sh` together.
- Changing updater behavior: work in `updater/`, preserve persisted-state compatibility unless intentionally versioned, and check service/install behavior around failed, cancelled, or interrupted privileged installs.
- Changing updater service lifecycle: inspect `packaging/linux/codex-app-updater.service` and the package maintainer scripts for Debian, RPM, and pacman effects.
- Changing runtime CLI discovery or install behavior: keep the launcher best-effort; warnings may not block Electron startup unless the task explicitly changes that policy.
- Changing dependencies or supported runtime requirements: update `scripts/install-deps.sh`, `README.md`, and package metadata or maintainer docs as needed.
- Syncing from `upstream`: use the user-global
  `syncing-forks-with-upstream` skill, read
  `docs/maintainers/fork-divergences.md`, `.agents/fork-sync-policy.toml`, and
  `docs/maintainers/fork-sync-policy.md`, then triage incoming changes against
  the intentional fork contracts before pushing. If the external skill is
  unavailable, follow the maintainer policy directly and record that fallback in
  the sync ledger.

## Generated And Runtime Artifacts

- `codex-app/` and `codex-*-app/`: generated Linux app trees and launcher output.
- `codex-app/codex-app-version.env`: generated package-version metadata read
  from the official OpenAI app bundle.
- `dist/`: native package output.
- `ChatGPT.dmg`: cached official OpenAI ChatGPT DMG.
- `~/.config/codex-app-updater/config.toml`: updater runtime config.
- `~/.local/state/codex-app-updater/`: updater state and service logs.
- `~/.cache/codex-app-updater/`: downloaded DMGs, rebuild workspaces, staged packages, and build logs.
- `~/.cache/codex-app/launcher.log` and `~/.local/state/codex-app/app.pid`: launcher diagnostics and app liveness state.

Inspect generated artifacts to verify behavior, but do not make them the only source of a durable fix.

## Validation Policy

Choose the smallest validation set that covers the changed behavior.

- Shell changes: run `bash -n` on edited shell scripts.
- Updater changes: run `cargo check -p codex-app-updater` and targeted updater tests; run full updater tests for state, install, or CLI changes.
- Package changes: build the affected package format when practical and inspect package metadata plus the first package file listing.
- Launcher or installer changes: regenerate or inspect `codex-app/start.sh` and check launcher logs when runtime behavior is involved.
- Webview changes: verify the local server still serves expected Codex webview startup assets before Electron launch.

If a preferred validation cannot run because a host tool is missing, state the missing tool and run the closest useful static or targeted check.
